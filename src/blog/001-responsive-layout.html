          <h2>The Importance of Responsive Design</h2>
          <p>
            With a plethora of devices at their disposal, users today can access
            the web from screens of all sizes. Hence, creating a
            <b>responsive website layout</b> is more critical than ever. It
            ensures that your site is accessible and visually appealing on a
            wide range of devices, be it a smartphone, tablet, or desktop.
          </p>

          <h2>Understanding em and rem Units</h2>
          <p>
            When creating responsive designs, CSS units like em and rem are your
            best friends. They are <b>relative units</b> that allow for flexible
            spacing, sizing, and more, making your website adapt beautifully to
            different screen sizes.
          </p>

          <p>
            The <b>em</b> unit is relative to the font-size of its closest
            parent. This means that if a parent element has a font-size of 16px,
            1em in that scope would equal 16px. On the other hand, the
            <b>rem</b> (root em) unit is relative to the root—or the
            html—element, which provides a consistent measurement across your
            site.
          </p>

          <h2>Implementing em and rem</h2>
          <p>Utilizing em and rem is relatively simple. Here is an example:</p>
          <pre class="language-html"><code>  html { font-size: 16px; }
  p { font-size: 1em; }
  h1 { font-size: 2.5rem; }</code></pre>
          <p>
            In this example, the paragraph text will be 16px (1em = 16px) as
            it's relative to the root. The header text will be 40px (2.5 * 16px
            = 40px) regardless of its parent's font-size.
          </p>

          <h2>The Power of Responsive Units</h2>
          <p>
            By leveraging em and rem units, you can ensure your website scales
            nicely with the user's preference. If a user prefers larger text,
            rem and em units will scale accordingly, whereas px units will
            remain static.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, these units allow for more harmonious design, as elements
            can be sized proportionally to each other. It's an essential aspect
            of responsive design and a best practice every web developer should
            master.
