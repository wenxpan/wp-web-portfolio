          <p>
            For a while now, I've been entranced by the game Wordle. As a junior
            developer studying at Coder Academy, I decided to build my own
            Wordle clone using Python for my assignment. With the assignment
            offering an excellent opportunity to put the skills I have learnt to
            test, I embarked on my development journey. The process was spread
            across several days, with each day dedicated to building different
            features.
          </p>
          <h2>Day 1: Planning and Initialization</h2>
          <p>
            The project started with planning. I laid down the foundation for
            the project and prepared for the journey ahead. I mapped out a
            features plan and made sure that I had all the necessary libraries
            and tools. The entire development process can be viewed in a
            <a href="https://trello.com/b/QJX1M5UE/t1a3-implementation-plan"
              >Trello</a
            >
            board.
          </p>
          <h2>Day 2-4: Implementing Core Features</h2>
          <p>
            Over these days, I implemented the Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
            features. This included generating a random 5-letter word, taking
            and analysing user input, incorporating a main play loop,
            highlighting letters based on analysis, exporting the record as a
            txt file, adding "play again" and "give up" commands, and lastly,
            checking the spelling of the guess.
          </p>
          <p>
            I extensively used the pytest and random libraries, and ensured each
            piece of code was tested before being integrated. I used external
            packages to check the validity of words and used colouring packages
            for visually appealing feedback. File handling was revisited for
            record exports, and loops and error handling mechanisms were set up
            for the gameplay commands.
          </p>
          <h2>Day 5: Reviewing and Refactoring Code</h2>
          <p>
            After completing the core features, I reviewed the code, refactored
            where necessary, and optimised it to ensure smooth functioning. I
            also revised test cases and ran them again to verify the changes.
          </p>
          <h2>Day 6-7: Implementing Bonus Features</h2>
          <p>
            With the basic game established, I implemented bonus features. I
            added a user profile and customisation options. I created a player
            class to handle player data and implemented automatic saving in the
            play loop. I added various player settings like different word
            lists, a function to customise number of chances, and a feature to
            rename the player.
          </p>

          <h2>Day 8-9: Wrapping Up and Documentation</h2>
          <p>
            The project was wrapped up with final tweaks and polishing.
            Documentation was written to ensure the code was understandable and
            maintainable by others. Lastly, I created functions to export all or
            individual game records, revising the code to ensure it adheres to
            the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
          </p>
          <h2>Day 10-11: Contingency</h2>
          <p>
            Contingency days were kept for dealing with any unexpected problems.
            Any last-minute issues were solved and final touches added.
          </p>
          <h2>Day 12: Final Review and Submission</h2>
          <p>
            With all features implemented, tested, and reviewed, the final
            product was ready for submission. The Python-based Wordle clone was
            complete!
          </p>
          <p>
            Reflecting on the process, I believe it was a great experience that
            honed my skills and taught me how to work systematically on a
            project, implementing and testing features one by one.
