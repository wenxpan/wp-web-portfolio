## Description

### Purpose

The portfolio website is designed to present me as a fullstack web developer and IT professional.

### Target audience

The target audience for the porfolio website is any potential employer and client looking to hire a web developer and/or IT professional who is professional and has positive work ethic. They should have technical knowledge in the general IT industry.

### Functionality / features

This website includes the following pages:

- Home page: Landing page that includes a hero section with CTA button (Get in touch) and summary content from all the other main pages, presenting an overview of the website and encouraging the viewer to get in touch with me and explore different pages of my website.
- About page: Includes information on my coding experiences, skillsets, work history and interests, and a link to my resume. An image slider of cat pics is at the bottom of the page to add a bit of fun to my website.
- Project page: Showcasing a list of my projects (currently placeholder content), with links of demo videos on youtube.
- Blog page: A list of my blog articles, sorted as newest first. Clicking on each preview card will direct to the article page.

- Layout is responsive across different device width, include mobile, tablet and desktop.
- Relative units (such as percentages and `rem`) and `max-width/height` are used for better responsiveness, making content adapt to different screens and font sizes.
- Semantic html elements are used to achieve better accessibility.
- A header and footer are included on all pages, which shows copyright information and navigates to all the main pages.
- A page intro section on all main pages (blog, about, projects, contact) to help users navigate the site.
